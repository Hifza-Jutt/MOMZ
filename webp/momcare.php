    <h1>1st Trimester of Pregnancy</h1>
    <h2>Laying the Foundation for a Healthy Journey</h2>

    <p class="intro">
      The first trimester (weeks 1 to 12) is a delicate and foundational phase of pregnancy. This is when your body begins a remarkable transformation to support a growing life, and it's crucial for moms‚Äîespecially new-generation moms‚Äîto understand the physical, nutritional, and emotional needs during this period. You might experience a mix of joy, anxiety, nausea, and even disbelief‚Äîbut remember, you're not alone.
    </p>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>ü©∫ Health Tips and Medical Checkups</h3>
      <p>
        During these early weeks, confirming your pregnancy through a blood or urine test is the first step. Once confirmed, schedule your first prenatal visit immediately. Your doctor will perform a full physical exam, record your medical history, and suggest essential blood tests, ultrasounds, and supplements (especially folic acid and iron). Regular monthly checkups are a must to track your baby‚Äôs development and catch any early concerns.
      </p>
      <p>
        Avoid self-medicating or falling for common pregnancy myths such as <em>"you shouldn't eat papaya"</em> or <em>"you must eat for two."</em> These beliefs can be misleading and harmful. Always follow medical advice, not hearsay.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>üçé Diet and Nutrition</h3>
      <p>Your baby‚Äôs major organs begin developing in this trimester, so a balanced and nutrient-rich diet is vital. Focus on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Folic acid to prevent birth defects</li>
        <li>Iron and Vitamin C to prevent anemia</li>
        <li>Calcium and Vitamin D for bone health</li>
        <li>Fiber-rich foods to ease constipation</li>
        <li>Plenty of water to stay hydrated</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Eat small, frequent meals to combat nausea. Ginger tea and dry crackers may help morning sickness. Avoid caffeine, processed foods, and anything unhygienic.</p>
   <p>One of the most important nutrients in early pregnancy is folic acid, which helps prevent neural tube defects. Doctors typically recommend taking 400‚Äì600 mcg of folic acid daily. You can also boost your intake through natural sources such as leafy greens, citrus fruits, and lentils.<br>

Iron is another key nutrient, as your body needs to produce more blood to support your growing baby. Pairing iron-rich foods like spinach or red meat with sources of vitamin C, such as oranges or tomatoes, helps improve absorption. Avoid drinking tea or coffee immediately after iron-rich meals, as they may reduce its effectiveness.<br>

Calcium and vitamin D are vital for the development of your baby‚Äôs bones and teeth. Try to include dairy products like milk and yogurt, eggs, and safe sun exposure in your daily routine. Fiber is equally important ‚Äî pregnancy hormones can slow down digestion, so eating whole grains, fresh fruits with skin, and vegetables like carrots or sweet potatoes can help prevent constipation.

Staying hydrated is just as important as eating well. Aim for 8‚Äì10 glasses of water each day. You can also include other fluids like coconut water or ginger tea, especially if you‚Äôre experiencing nausea or vomiting.</p>

    <h3>üí§ Coping with Discomfort</h3>
    <p>As your pregnancy progresses into the third trimester, your body experiences increased physical strain. Common discomforts include backaches, swollen feet, shortness of breath, and trouble sleeping. These changes are completely normal but can be managed with a few simple habits to help you feel more at ease.<br>

To support better rest and reduce strain, try using maternity pillows that provide proper belly and back support. Opt for soft, breathable clothing that doesn't restrict your movement. Sleeping on your left side is highly recommended, as it improves blood flow to the baby and reduces pressure on internal organs.<br>

Light breathing exercises and prenatal stretches can ease muscle tension and calm your mind. They also help prepare you mentally and physically for labor.</p>
    <p>Use maternity pillows, wear comfortable clothes, and sleep on your left side. Practice breathing exercises daily. If you feel reduced fetal movement, severe pain, or water leakage‚Äîseek help immediately.</p>
  </div>
  <p class="alert">
üö® Go to the hospital if you experience regular contractions, bleeding, water leakage, or decreased baby movement. These may be signs that labor is starting or something is wrong.
</p>



    <p>The third trimester (week 27‚Äìbirth) is all about preparing for labor. Weekly checkups, baby monitoring, and resting are essential. Start packing your hospital bag.</p>

  <h1>Post-Pregnancy Care</h1>
  <h2>Healing the Body, Nurturing the Bond</h2>

  <p class="intro">
    The postpartum period (also called the fourth trimester) is full of changes. Your body needs time to recover while you care for your newborn. This is a time for love, healing, support, and mental well-being.
  </p>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>ü©∫ Physical Recovery and Medical Follow-Up</h3>
    <p>Attend your postpartum checkup within 6 weeks. If you had stitches or a C-section, keep the area clean and dry. Get plenty of sleep and avoid heavy lifting. Eat healthy and take iron and calcium supplements regularly.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>üçº Feeding and Nutrition</h3>

      <li>Fenugreek (methi) and fennel (saunf) to boost milk</li>

    <p>It‚Äôs normal to feel emotional or even overwhelmed. Talk to your loved ones. Practice skin-to-skin contact, respond to your baby‚Äôs cries, and rest when the baby sleeps. If you feel persistent sadness or hopelessness, speak to a doctor‚Äîit could be postpartum depression.</p>
 
  </div>
  <p class="alert">
