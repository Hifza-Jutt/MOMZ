<div class="section">
  <h3>üß† Bonding and Development</h3>
  <p>Emotional well-being plays a powerful role in both your recovery and your baby‚Äôs development. The postpartum period can be overwhelming, but nurturing emotional connection with your newborn helps ease stress and supports healthy bonding from the very beginning.<br>

Simple, loving actions can build a strong connection between you and your baby. Talking, humming, or singing to your baby‚Äîeven during pregnancy‚Äîhelps them recognize your voice and feel safe. Once your baby is born, start skin-to-skin contact as soon as possible. This practice regulates the baby‚Äôs heartbeat and temperature while strengthening emotional closeness.<br>

Responding to your baby‚Äôs cries with a calm voice and gentle touch fosters trust and emotional security. These early moments of bonding also boost your own mental well-being and encourage the natural release of oxytocin‚Äîthe ‚Äúlove hormone.‚Äù</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Talk, hum, and sing to your baby</li>
    <li>Respond with calm and gentle touch to cries</li>
    <li>Start skin-to-skin contact immediately after birth</li>
  </ul>

<h2>First Milestones and Muscle Strength</h2>
<p class="intro">Your baby becomes more alert, begins to smile, and responds to your voice. This stage is key for muscle and sensory development.</p>
<div class="section">
  <h3>üçΩÔ∏è Feeding</h3>
  <p>After delivery, feeding your newborn becomes one of your most important tasks. Whether you choose to breastfeed, formula feed, or combine both, the goal is to ensure your baby receives all the essential nutrients they need to grow and thrive.<br>

Breast milk is naturally rich in antibodies and nutrients, making it the ideal first food for most babies. If you're able to breastfeed, try to do so exclusively for the first six months, as recommended by health organizations. However, if breastfeeding isn't possible or if you choose formula feeding, rest assured that modern formulas are designed to closely match breast milk in nutritional value.</p>

  <h3>üß† Behavior & Milestones</h3>
 <p>During the early months of life, your baby begins to explore the world through movement, sound, and touch. This is a crucial time for cognitive and emotional development, so it‚Äôs important to create an environment that nurtures curiosity and builds strong connections.<br>

You can support your baby‚Äôs growth by encouraging interaction through simple activities like reading picture books, playing soft music, and using colorful toys or games that stimulate the senses. These activities help improve memory, recognition, and emotional bonding.

As your baby becomes more active, provide a safe and open space for crawling, stretching, and reaching. This promotes motor skill development and allows them to build strength and coordination at their own pace.

Offering love, attention, and safe opportunities for discovery helps lay the foundation for healthy behavior and developmental milestones in the months ahead.</p>
